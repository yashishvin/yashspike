To startoff with the project
once you have created a folder
npm install expo-cli --global
once npm is installed
expo init yashspike-username
you would need to choose the blank option
after that in your folder you should probably see a folder with the name yashspike-username
then there are a few npm packages which need to be installed
	npm i base-64
  npm install navigation
  npm install @react-navigation/stack
  npm install @react-navigation/bottom-tabs
apart from this if you stillget an error saying module with a name apart from the file names specified in the repository look the error up most likely you will need to npm install the lost module and that will work
if it still doesnt work shoot a message on slack and I will look into it
